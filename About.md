Fitness

Working out has become really important to me. Even if working out offered no other benefits, I do it to make me feel better. The gym is my meditation practice, my happy place, my oasis from distractions. I used to have a mediocre workout plan, but now I use workouts coming from comptrain.co/individuals/ (I receive no commission from this). These workouts are also completely scalable, and that's something that I always take advantage of. By following this program, I hit the right amount of volume and I can properly work, stretch, and rest all muscle groups each week.

Going to the gym is only one aspect of fitness. Training, sleep, stress, and a host of other factors affect your physique, but your diet is undoubtedly the most important one. I don't count calories or follow a strict paleo or atkins diet. I generally limit carbs and try to eat mostly vegetables and high quality meat. If my diet becomes imbalanced, I can notice it immediately in my performance at the gym and while working.

Healthcare

Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Not only does our healthcare system fail to care for many people, but it does so at a much higher expense than most other healthcare systems in the world. Our healthcare system is broken.

We arrived in this position through several pieces of well-intentioned legislation over the past 70 years. As our healthcare system grew, insurance plans are complicated, billing systems became a nightmare, and price transparency has virtually vanished from the field.

Patients deserve higher quality care at a lower price. Whether it's by contributing to a medical breakthrough, consulting providers on how to reduce costs, or working with the government to implement new studies through Medicare, my goal is to contribute improvements to our healthcare system.

Reading

Reading was a huge hobby of mine when I was younger, but unfortunately I've gotten away from that habit. This website will help me commit to moving through the large collection of books

Favorite non-fiction: The Effective Executive, by Peter Drucker

Favorite Fiction: Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift

Gaming

When I was younger I had much, much more time to play videogames. I nearly stopped playing video games while in college, but now I play them as one of my few leisuer activities. I recently finished The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which I consider to be the best game I have ever played, and I recently finished The Last Of Us, which is a game that delivers an Oscar-worthy experience. Upcoming games I'm looking forward to trying are Horizon: Zero Dawn, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Dark Souls III.

I love playing board games. I prefer strategy board games, where you have near-complete control over whether you win or lose. I would be hard pressed to tell you of things I enjoy doing more than winning a game by countering my opponents' strategy. My recommendations for board games are as follows

New Players - Codenames, Ticket to Ride, King of New York, Mysterium, Machi Koro, Pandemic, Patchwork, Citadels, Splendor

Experienced Players - Catan + Expansions, Agricola, Dominion, 7 Wonders, Shadows Over Camelot, Ascension

Current Favorite Game - Captain Sonar (It's real-time battleship where you play on a team with 3 of your friends against 4 opponents. It's amazing)

Best for 2: 7 Wonders, Patchwork

Best for 3: Catan

Best for 4: Ticket to Ride, King of New York, Pandemic, Dominion

Best for 6-8: Captain Sonar, Shadows Over Camelot, Citadels

Excellent for 3-5: Agricola, Mysterium, Splendor, Ascension

Investing

In an ideal world, I would have plenty of time to make investing decisions based on hours of resarch learning about every security I purchase. Since I do not have the time, my investing strategy needs to be fairly automated. My current investing strategy generally revolves around putting money in several low risk, under-valued companies based on Benjamin Graham's value investing philosophy, with some additional capital reserved for dividend yielding stocks and a small amount reserved for short-term risky trades. I started investing in 2014 with mixed success, but I have beaten the market's return of 20% in the past 9 months using this new strategy.

I also strongly advise against using certain investing services. If you are being charged over 1% of the value of your portfolio per year, they had better be pulling in ridiculous returns. Services like this can wind up costing you 50% of your gains over the course of a 40-year career.

Instead, put your money into Mutual Funds and Exchange Trading Funds (ETFs) that track the market with low fees, generally below 0.5%

And for anyone who's scared of investing, if you invested a sum of money at any point in time in the past 100 years, you would generally wind up with a 6-7% annual gain as of 30 years later. You should invest. Even if you're risk averse, invest some of it with your money. Your money magically becomes worth less due to inflation each year.

Real Estate

In 2016, I started a property development company in Philadelphia with 3 of my friends. I think property is an excellent way to both make and lose money, just like investing. You've gotta be careful with your opportunities and the people you choose to work with. Hopefully this company is able to grow enough that I can post a link to it on this site.
